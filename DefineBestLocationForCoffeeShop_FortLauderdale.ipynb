    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We live in a world where everyday people generate data of his behavior and there are a lot of machines that recompile that information. Also, there are a business that uses lots of data available in their systems for making the wiser decision possible for invest their money.\n",
    "In this world of velocity of information, people try hard to reduce the time of the unnecessary activities in their routine, like having the coffee cup that keep you going all day. Thinking in this, we could think that people that has no public transports, and drives long distances to their home to their jobs, or people who travels for shopping or entertainment and wants to improve the use of their time would be interested in a modality of coffee to go, like the auto-services of the junk food.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is the best place to locate a coffee shop? When you are trying to open a new local just the information that you can recompile inside the business is not enough because there are some geographical variables that can make a difference in choosing the best location and make a positive impact on the business on the short, middle and long ride. The idea of a good location depends of the objectives of the owner(s), but we must be near of the clients, be accessible to the potential clients, near of the raw material supplier because we could also need to reduce logistic cots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Interests\n",
    "\n",
    "People that can be interested in this business idea is the people that want to initiate in their own coffee shop or someone who is looking to open a new local or to relocate the one that is actually working but needs to improve the affluence of people or reduce some logistic costs at Fort Lauderdale - Florida.\n"

    "Most of the venues like the coffee shop at the United States has their location and ranking at the Foursquare application, the Fort Lauderdale at the Florida State, has a lot of traffic of tourists for entertainment or for shopping, but there is also the reality of the people who lives there and uses their own cars for their rides to the jobs at the morning.\n",
    "Other web information I'll be using is the location of the banks or other business offices, and some residential neighborhoods that can help to make clear where are middle points that we can identify for the location we are seeking. There could be also some points of interest like the airport or the rental cars offices where some journeys begin.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Machine Learning choose to perform the principal analysis is Clustering with K-means, because we need to use the geographic information of all the neighborhoods at the Fort Lauderdale City to find out which ones are more similar at the venues and the kind of possible clients at that location.\n",

It's also possible using the maps to visualize where are some important points at the tourist routs as the rental cars, the marina, the ferry, where are some places at the surroundings that call the attention of many tourist as the Orlando Outlets Theme Parks, Outlets, etc, this places demand that the tourist uses a particular car for executing the leisure plan.\n",

    "The purpose of this project was to find a good location for a coffee shop at Fort Lauderdale Florida. The limitation of the project is that we only considerate the perspective of the data available outside, specially the geographic data, to visualize the opportunities that the business can make with two kind of potential clients, the residents and the tourists. This project must be complemented with other information that the stakeholders, the future owners consider necessary to stand out with their brand, and to try to reduce some logistic costs, operational. There are also the other considerations when they try to precise a street, because it must be accessible and must be between those kind of place residential and industry/commercial zones, or between the hotel/ rental car and the entertainment or attractive places."
